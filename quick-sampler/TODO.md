TODO
====

* Expose JSON and text formats, too.
* Get tests passing with PhantomJS
* Make the navbar collapse at a smaller width.
* Add logo of plant sprouting from 10-sided dice
* Allow random seed to be specified over multiple inputs.
  - Display the seed before the output.
* Add a "test" option that uses the test cases (and should tests
  run automatically when starting up?).
  - Test button is white.  After pressing, turns green and says "Tested"
    with a check mark.
* Automate keeping the version number in synch across bower.json,
  package.json, and in the page footer.  Can this be a Grunt task?
* Simplify or automate steps of the release process.
* Include "min" attribute in form-input directive only when input
  type is "number".
* Think about internationalization.
