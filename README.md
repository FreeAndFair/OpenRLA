# OpenRLA
Free & Fair's early pilot open source RLA support software.

See also [FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA: Software to facilitate risk-limiting audits at the state level, developed for the state of Colorado](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA)
and forks.

Note that the rivest-sampler-tests directory is an older copy of [cjerdonek/rivest-sampler-tests: Test cases for Ronald L. Rivest's pseudo-random sampling algorithm](https://github.com/cjerdonek/rivest-sampler-tests), and note also [Python 3 port by nealmcb · Pull Request #1 · nealmcb/rivest-sampler-tests](https://github.com/nealmcb/rivest-sampler-tests/pull/1)
which should show up in it's own python-oriented sampler repo "soon".
